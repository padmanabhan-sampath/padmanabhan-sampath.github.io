# ISS SSTV


--the 

The International Space Station (ISS) houses Amateur Radio equipment and most astronauts onboard poses amateur radio license. Apart from the usual voice communication, the ISS operates as 

1. Voice radio repeater (Uplink: 145.99 MHz Downlink: 437.8 MHz)
2. Packet radio repeater (145.825 MHz)
3. SSTV transmitter (145.5 MHz)

For most of the time the cross-band repeater and/or digital (APRS) repeater are in operation. This will be disabled for the occacional School contacts outreach program, EVA missions or other reasons

The SSTV (Slow Scan Television) is a protocol for transmission of images encoded as audio tones via RF. SSTV transmissions from ISS are conducted few times a year either by ARISS or MAI. The SSTV radio hardware is housed in the Russian segment of the ISS. 

The MAI, Russian Space Administration occationally conducts experiments through SSTV transmission from the ISS which can be received by anyone with receiver cable of tuning to SSTV frequency 145.5 MHz. The images transmissted usually are related some significance to space exploration.

It is awe inspiring to know that you can receive an image directly from a satellite orbiting the Earth at ~400 KM height. And all this can be achieved with minimal handheld transceiver and an android phone.

This blog post provides brief instructions on receving SSTV images form ISS using two setup: 1) bare bones 2) a slightly better setup.


# Quick overview

* Radio settings
  * VFO frequency: 145.50 MHz
  * Squelch: lowest
  * Volume: 50% ( make sure it does not saturate phone's audio input)
* Robot36 App
  * Decoding: Auto or PD120
* ISS status check
  * SSTV Blogspot
  * ARISS ISS Live status
  * ARISS ISS status


# Setup and tests

1. Basic setup
    1. Pass prediction
    2. Hardware RF test
    3. Day 0
       1. Status checks: ARISS, blogsite, sat status by ppl, 

2. Extended setup
