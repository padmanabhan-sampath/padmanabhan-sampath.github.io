# Extended Setup

While the basic setup would suffice for SSTV transmission, I wanted to try other ISS radio functions esp the APRS packet repeater. I had build a Yagi antenna.

Advantages
1. Eleminates external noise: as the audio from the radio is directly fed into the phone
2. Directional antenna provides higher gain making it possible to receive weak signals.
3. It is more intuitive to the point the antenna at the satellite :)

Hardware needed
1. 3 element Yagi antenna
2. audio interface circuit
3. Basic setup

Here I will present a quick setup comparisons and demonstrate the advantage/important of good location 

This is an SSTV reception which happened in Dec-2020. 9V1YP and myself, 9V1DT we both were looking to the receive the sstv reception in Singapore, just 30 KMs apart from different locations. I was on a small hilltop, with a clear horizon view and 9V1YP was on the roof of a car park in an urban setting.

9V1YP's setup is top of the line wheres the other side is mostly homebrew. However, the advantage of having clear line of sight provides a slight edge in receiving the last image.

From the image series, we can see that
