My name is Padmanabhan Sampath Kumar.  My interests lie in exploring and experimenting with new technologies at the intersection of AI, sensing, and embedded systems. This personal website is for documenting my hobby projects that I worked on. The topics will range from amateur radio, photography and embedded systems.

I am currently working as an Asst. Principal Research Scientist at [ST Engineering](https://www.stengg.com/){:target="_blank"}  leading the research efforts on AI for Predictive maintenance and Edge analytics. Prior to this, I was working as a Scientist at [Delta Electronics](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index){:target="_blank"}  focusing on developing novel sensing solutions. Earlier to joining Delta Electronics, I was affiliated with [Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/rr-ntu-corp-lab){:target="_blank"}  during my PhD studies.

I have received my M.Sc. degree in computer control and automation and Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} . I have received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the [College of Engineering, Guindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Engineering,_Guindy){:target="_blank"} , Anna University.
