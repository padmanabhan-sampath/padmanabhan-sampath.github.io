Hi there, my name is Padmanabhan Sampath Kumar. Welcome to my blog! 

 My interests lie in exploring and experimenting with new technologies at the intersection of AI, sensing, and embedded systems. This personal website is for documenting my hobby projects in amateur radio, photography and embedded systems.

 I am currently working as Senior Electronics Engineer - Sensors at [Dyson](https://www.dyson.com.sg/){:target="_blank"}, where I develop sensing systems for new product categories. My prior affiliations include [ST Engineering](https://www.stengg.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Delta Electronics](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index){:target="_blank"}, and [Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/rr-ntu-corp-lab){:target="_blank"}.


I have a Masters' degree in Computer Control and Automation and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}. My B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering is from the [College of Engineering, Guindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Engineering,_Guindy){:target="_blank"}, Anna University.
