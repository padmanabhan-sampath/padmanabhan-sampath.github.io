Hi there, my name is Padmanabhan Sampath Kumar. Welcome to my blog! 

 My interests lie in exploring and experimenting with new technologies at the intersection of AI, sensing, and embedded systems. This personal website is for documenting my hobby projects in amateur radio, photography and embedded systems.

I am currently working as an Asst. Principal Research Scientist at [ST Engineering](https://www.stengg.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I lead the research efforts in AI for Predictive Maintenance and Edge Analytics. Prior to this, I was working as a Scientist at [Delta Electronics](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index){:target="_blank"}, and developed novel sensing solutions. I was also affiliated with [Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/rr-ntu-corp-lab){:target="_blank"}  during my PhD.

I have a Masters' degree in Computer Control and Automation and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}. My B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering is from the [College of Engineering, Guindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Engineering,_Guindy){:target="_blank"}, Anna University.
